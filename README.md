This repository contains an end-to-end MLOps implementation for a Travel Analytics platform built using users, flights, and hotels datasets. The project focuses on developing, deploying, and managing machine learning models for flight price prediction, gender classification, and hotel recommendation.

The trained model is exposed through a Flask REST API, containerized using Docker, and deployed on Kubernetes to ensure scalable and reliable serving. Automated retraining workflows are orchestrated using Apache Airflow, while Jenkins enables continuous integration and deployment. In addition to price prediction, the system includes a gender classification model and a collaborative filtering–based hotel recommendation engine with a Streamlit web interface for interactive exploration.
